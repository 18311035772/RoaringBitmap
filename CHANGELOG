version 0.1.2 (April 15th, 2014)
  - serialization format should not be the same for both org.roaringbitmap.RoaringBitmap
  and org.roaringbitmap.buffer.RoaringBitmap

    added the serialize/deserialize methods throughout 
    to bypass Java serialization overhead

    wish to query the memory usage
