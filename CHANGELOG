version 0.1.2 (April 15th, 2014)
  - serialization format should not be the same for both org.roaringbitmap.RoaringBitmap
  and org.roaringbitmap.buffer.RoaringBitmap
  - Performance of org.roaringbitmap.buffer.RoaringBitmap should not be on par with
  org.roaringbitmap.RoaringBitmap when the buffer is backed by an array


version 0.1.1 (March 28th, 2014)
  - made serialized format slightly more concise:
    added the serialize/deserialize methods throughout 
    to bypass Java serialization overhead
  - added the serializedSizeInBytes() method for users who 
    wish to query the memory usage

version 0.1.0 (March 21th, 2014)
  - Another fix for serialization
  - Introduction of the org.bitmap.buffer package for memory-mapped bitmaps


version 0.0.2 (March 12th, 2014)
  - Serialization fix (Jon Alvarado)

version 0.0.1 (March 3rd, 2014)
